# ShowCursorPos
A very simple program that will show the coordinates of your mouse cursor.
The coordinates are the pixels on your display/monitor, with the origin in the upper left corner.

X = horizontal

Y = vertical

NOTE: I just couldn't find anything like it for windows and this is as simple as it gets. Maybe someone has the same problem and finds this easy solution :)
